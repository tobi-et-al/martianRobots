Approach:
----
Seperation of concerns 
 - Robot and grid displays handled by the controller
 - data stored separately
 - view rendered separately

libraries 
 - lo dash for data manipulation
 - jquery for selector 

notes
    - original positions are represented by grayed imaged
    - final positions by ungrayed imaged

Potential improvements

    -structure 
        - minified code 
        - smaller libraries
    -potenetial code improvements
        - missing validation for commands parse via text box
        - regex to  validate input format
        - animation to show robot movement
        - remove hardcoded images to css 
        - simplify functionalities
        - remove heavy handed libraries
